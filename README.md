# newbie-Ocaml
A set of programs written in an attempt to learn OCaml.
These currently fall into two categories  
1) Highly commented example programs  
-firstprogram.ml  
-helloWorld.ml  
-newline.ml  
-scoping.ml  
-fibonacci.ml  
-chess.ml  

These six were literally the first six programs I made in OCaml.
They are pretty heavily commented and don't do much of interest
except for possibly the last two.  

2)Rosetta Code solutions  
-compass.ml  
-pig.ml  
-reverse.ml  
-sundays.ml  
-temperature.ml  

These five contain very little comments and can be found on Rosetta
Code as OCaml examples.

I intend to start working on a third category comprised of programs
which are actually useful outside of their pedagogical value.

HOW TO RUN  
All of these are intended to be run as ./ocaml #PROGRAM#, except for
sundays.ml which takes an additional command line argument corresponding
to the year.

DEPENDENCIES  
With the exception of chess.ml, none of these have have dependencies
outside of the standard library. chess.ml requires Core to be installed.
